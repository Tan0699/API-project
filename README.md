FnF is a full stack web application that is inspired by [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/). Airbnb is known as "Air Bed and Breakfast." This web application allows for people who are traveling to rent out places to stay from property owners. This service allows for people to better accomodate themselves when they are away from home. FnF is a spinoff of their application, why rent a home with no company when you can rent one with friends? Book a spot [here](https://shinymango.herokuapp.com/) now!
